Install:

   pip install -e .[test]

run:

   py.test -s -v integration/

If you want to keep the created temp-dir around:

   py.test --keep-tempdir -v integration/

The fixtures also set up a "flogtool gather" process and dump all the
logs from all the running processes (introducer, 5 storage nodes,
alice, bob) to a tempfile.


Some Things To Remember
-----------------------

The "normal" grid uses the fixture-provided "introducer"; if you
create a new node under it (especially one that provides storage) you
SHOULD clean it up (so subsequent tests don't get surprised by missing
/ weird storage nodes).

Same for the "tor_introducer" grid.
