   .. a very short, very high-level overview that explains the *user-facing
      value* of tahoe.  Note the security properties of tahoe are great but
      they are an *add on* to its real user-facing value.  This document is
      not about security properties.  It can have an out-link to a document
      about the threat model tahoe tries to solve, details about security
      properties of different parts of the system, etc.

   about-tahoe-lafs

   .. a very short, very high-level overview of how to actually use the client
      portions of tahoe.  this tells anyone who has decided tahoe offers value
      to them how to run tahoe so they can start to realize that value.  this
      document focuses on the 90% use-case.  it's not about how to configure
      the SFTP interface or compute the optimal n/k for a grid size s.  it's
      the shortest possible path between "I like tahoe and don't have it" to
      "I have tahoe doing *something* [and I still like it]".  There might be
      out-links from this document to many others which describe paths to
      other adjacent destinations.  There might also be out-links to security
      and operational documentation that is specific relevant to the end point
      this document gets a user to.

   tahoe-lafs-for-clients

   .. a very short, very high-level overview of how to actually use the server
      portions of tahoe.  this is like the above: it gets someone from nothing
      to *something* server-related in the shortest path possible.  it can
      link out to other guides for other ways you might operate a tahoe
      server, to server-side security relevant information, etc.

   tahoe-lafs-for-servers

   .. by the time anyone gets this far they have at least had the opportunity
      to be walked through setting up either a client or a server.  now let's
      get them involved in tahoe development!  give them the high-level view
      of tahoe development and how they can participate.  this includes
      software development, documentation work, chatting with the community,
      anything that helps tahoe-the-project succeed.

   .. anyone who is still reading might be particularly serious about their
      tahoe use.  help them see the big picture now.
