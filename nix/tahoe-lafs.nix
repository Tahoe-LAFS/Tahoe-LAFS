  # Most of the time this is not exactly the release version (eg 1.16.0).

  # and we'll bump this up at the time of each release.
  #
  # It's difficult to read the version from Git the way the Python code does
  # for two reasons.  First, doing so involves populating the Nix expression
  # with values from the source.  Nix calls this "import from derivation" or
  # "IFD" (<https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Import_From_Derivation>).  This is
  # discouraged in most cases - including this one, I think.  Second, the
  # Python code reads the contents of `.git` to determine its version.  `.git`
  # is not a reproducable artifact (in the sense of "reproducable builds") so
  # it is excluded from the source tree by default.  When it is included, the
  # package tends to be frequently spuriously rebuilt.
