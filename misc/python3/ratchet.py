'''Ratchet up passing tests, or ratchet down failing tests.

Usage:

    ratchet.py <"up" or "down"> <junitxml file path> <tracking file path>


If <junitxml file path> does not exist, you'll get a FileNotFoundError:

    >>> _test_main('up', '/some-garbage-hopefully-1afefede', NotImplemented)   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    FileNotFoundError: ...

If <tracking file path> does not exist, that's fine:

    >>> _test_main(*_mk('up', '1'))
    Some tests not required to pass did:
      c0.t
    Conveniently, they have been added to `<tracking_path>` for you. Perhaps commit that?
    Previously 0 test(s) were required to pass, now 1 did.

Same if you're ratcheting down:

    >>> _test('down', '1')
    All and only tests expected to fail did.

If the test run has the same output as last time, it's all good:

    >>> _test('up', '01001110', '01001110')
    All and only tests required to pass did.

    >>> _test('down', '01001110', '10110001')
    All and only tests expected to fail did.

If there's a welcome change, that's noted:

    >>> _test('up', '0101', '0100')
    Some tests not required to pass did:
      c3.t
    Conveniently, they have been added to `<tracking_path>` for you. Perhaps commit that?
    Previously 1 test(s) were required to pass, now 2 did.

    >>> _test('down', '0011', '1110')
    Some tests expected to fail didn't:
      c2.t
    Conveniently, they have been removed from `<tracking_path>` for you. Perhaps commit that?
    Previously 3 test(s) were expected to fail, now 2 did.

And if there is an unwelcome change, that is noted as well:

    >>> _test('up', '1101', '1111')
    Some tests required to pass didn't:
      c2.t
    Previously 4 test(s) were required to pass, now 3 did.

    >>> _test('down', '0000', '1101')
    Some tests not expected to fail did:
      c2.t
    Previously 3 test(s) were expected to fail, now 4 did.

And if there are both welcome and unwelcome changes, they are both noted:

    >>> _test('up', '1101', '1011')
    Some tests not required to pass did:
      c1.t
    Conveniently, they have been added to `<tracking_path>` for you. Perhaps commit that?
    Some tests required to pass didn't:
      c2.t
    Previously 3 test(s) were required to pass, now 3 did.

    >>> _test('down', '0100', '1100')
    Some tests not expected to fail did:
      c2.t
      c3.t
    Some tests expected to fail didn't:
      c1.t
    Conveniently, they have been removed from `<tracking_path>` for you. Perhaps commit that?
    Previously 2 test(s) were expected to fail, now 3 did.
